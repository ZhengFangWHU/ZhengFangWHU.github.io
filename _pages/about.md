## About Me

I am **Zheng Fang**, from **Wuhan University**.  
My research focuses on **Audio Adversarial Attack** and **Large Language Model (LLM) Security**.  
Recently, I have been exploring **audio-LLM security** and **agent security**.

From **June to August 2024**, I worked as an **LLM Red Team Intern at Alibaba Group**, where I evaluated and stress-tested large language models and contributed to developing red-team methodologies for model safety.
